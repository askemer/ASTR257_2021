As part of UC Santa Cruz Astronomy's graduate curriculum, Andy Skemer and Xavier Prochaska teach an observing class, which includes a week-long field trip to Lick Observatory. The class is required of all first-year graduate students, and ensures that (1) our students will develop a broad range of observational skills at a time when opportunities to develop these skills are becoming more rare, and (2) our students will develop experience with Lick Observatory facilities, which will incentivize them to become immediate scientific
users.  We are planning two observations with the Shane 3-meter. We will observe edge-on galaxies with the KAST spectrograph to replicate the Vera Rubin experiment, and we will observe Neptune with Shane-AO to make a 3-color image.
